# Dev
You can install the necessary tailwindcss dependencies using npm:

`npm install`

Alternatively, you can use npx to run the Tailwind CSS CLI watcher directly from the internet without installing it locally:

> npx @tailwindcss/cli -i ./css/src/tailwindcss.css -o ./css/libs/tailwind.css --watch
